# IaC in shell Script to manage users and permitions 

This is a simple script to:

    Create Users' logins account,
    Create Users' groups,
    Create specifics folders for each group,
    Create One folder for the users to share things among themselves,
    Set permissions to those folders.

I use this script to automation this settings in a specific GNU/Linux server.
