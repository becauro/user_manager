# IaC in shell Script to manage users and permitions 

This is a simple script to create:

* Users' logins account,
* Users' groups,
* Specifics folders for each group,
* One folders for the users to share things,
* Permissions to those folders.


I use this script to automation this settings in a specific GNU/Linux server.
